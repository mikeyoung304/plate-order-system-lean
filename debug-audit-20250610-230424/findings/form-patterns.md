=== FORM PATTERNS ANALYSIS ===
Checking which forms use server actions vs client-side handlers

AuthForm Analysis:
⚠️ Uses onSubmit handler instead of server action
⚠️ However, it DOES call server actions (signIn/signUp) inside the handler
✅ This is a hybrid approach - not fully server-first but functional

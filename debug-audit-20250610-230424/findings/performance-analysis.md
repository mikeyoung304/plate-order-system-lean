=== PERFORMANCE IMPACT ANALYSIS ===
Analyzing performance implications of the restoration...

Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:

- 46 files use dynamic imports or lazy loading
- ✅ Good: Performance optimizations were retained
- ✅ KDS uses dynamic import for better load times

Removed Performance Features:

- ❌ optimized-client.ts (connection pooling)
- ❌ auth-cache.ts (session caching)
- ⚠️ May see increased Supabase connection overhead

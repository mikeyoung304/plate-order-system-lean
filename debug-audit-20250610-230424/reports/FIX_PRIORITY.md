## üî¥ Week 1: Critical Fixes (App Breaking)

### 1. Remove Orphaned Auth Hook Calls

These files are calling hooks that no longer exist and will crash:

```bash
# Files to fix:
- app/(auth)/kitchen/page-simple.tsx
- app/(auth)/kitchen/page.tsx
- app/(auth)/server/page-simple.tsx
- app/(auth)/server/page.tsx
- app/dashboard/page.tsx
- components/sidebar.tsx
```

**Fix**: Replace useAuth() with server-side session checks in layouts.

### 2. Remove ProtectedRoute Imports

These files import a component that was deleted:

```bash
# Files to fix:
- app/(auth)/admin/page.tsx
- app/(auth)/expo/page.tsx
- app/(auth)/kitchen/metrics/page.tsx
- app/(auth)/kitchen/page-complex.tsx
- app/(auth)/server/page-complex.tsx
- app/(auth)/server/page-refactored.tsx
```

**Fix**: Remove ProtectedRoute wrapper, rely on layout auth.

### 3. Fix AuthForm Pattern

```bash
# File to fix:
- components/auth/AuthForm.tsx
```

**Fix**: Convert to pure server action pattern (remove onSubmit).

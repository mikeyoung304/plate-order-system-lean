## ðŸš€ Implementation Guidelines

### Code Standards

1. **Use existing design system** - Leverage components/ui/ wherever possible
2. **Maintain TypeScript strict** - No any types, proper interfaces
3. **Follow naming conventions** - camelCase for functions, PascalCase for components
4. **Keep responsive-first** - Mobile-first CSS approach

### Testing Requirements

1. **Test major changes** - Run npm test after significant modifications
2. **Visual testing** - Check each component in different states
3. **Performance testing** - Monitor bundle size changes
4. **Accessibility testing** - Verify keyboard navigation

### Documentation Updates

1. **Update component docs** if behavior changes
2. **Note any breaking changes** in implementation
3. **Document new patterns** for future consistency

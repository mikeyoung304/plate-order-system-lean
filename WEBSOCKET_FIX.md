# üîß WebSocket Connection Fix

## The Error:
```
WebSocket connection to 'wss://eiipozoogrrfudhjoqms.supabase.co/realtime/v1/websocket...' failed
```

## What This Means:
- ‚úÖ Your app is working fine
- ‚úÖ You can still use all features
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Real-time updates won't work (orders won't auto-refresh)
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è The app will fall back to polling (refresh every 5 seconds)

## Quick Fixes:

### Option 1: Ignore It (Recommended for Testing)
The app works fine without real-time. It will:
- Fetch data when you load pages
- Auto-refresh every 5 seconds
- All features work normally

### Option 2: Fix Supabase Realtime

1. **Check Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/eiipozoogrrfudhjoqms/settings/api
   - Ensure "Realtime" is enabled

2. **Enable Realtime on Tables:**
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   ALTER TABLE orders REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
   ALTER TABLE kds_order_routing REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
   ALTER TABLE tables REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
   ALTER TABLE seats REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
   ```

3. **Check Project Status:**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/eiipozoogrrfudhjoqms
   - Make sure project is not paused
   - Free tier pauses after 1 week of inactivity

### Option 3: Disable Realtime Temporarily

Add this to your `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_REALTIME=true
```

## Is Your App Working?

Despite the WebSocket error, you should be able to:
- ‚úÖ Create an account
- ‚úÖ Log in
- ‚úÖ Access dashboard
- ‚úÖ Navigate to different views
- ‚úÖ Create orders (with manual refresh)

## Testing Without WebSocket:

1. **Create Account:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Click "Need an account? Create one"
   - Fill in details and submit

2. **Log In:**
   - Use your created credentials
   - You'll be redirected to dashboard

3. **Test Features:**
   - Click "Server View" 
   - Click "Kitchen View"
   - Everything works, just no auto-updates

## Bottom Line:
**This error doesn't break your app!** It's just a nice-to-have feature that's failing. You can continue testing and using the app normally.

   - Add performance monitoring dashboard

3. **Testing**

   - Unit tests for hooks
   - Integration tests for real-time features
   - E2E tests for critical flows

4. **Performance**

   - Add virtualization for 500+ orders
   - Implement service worker for offline caching
   - Add database indexes for common queries

5. **Accessibility**
   - ARIA labels for all interactive elements
   - Keyboard navigation for all features
   - Screen reader announcements

## 🎯 Key Achievements

1. **N+1 Query Prevention**: Optimized data fetching with proper joins
2. **Memory Leak Prevention**: Proper cleanup and unmount handling
3. **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript coverage with no `any` types
4. **User Experience**: Smooth, responsive UI with proper feedback

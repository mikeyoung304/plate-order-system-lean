## FIXES APPLIED ✅

### 1. Fixed Middleware Redirect

- **File**: `/lib/modassembly/supabase/middleware.ts`

- **Change**: `url.pathname = '/server'` → `url.pathname = '/dashboard'`
- **Impact**: Authenticated users now redirect to dashboard

### 2. Fixed Auth Actions Redirect

## EXPECTED LOGIN FLOW ✅

1. **Landing Page** (`/`)

   - Shows AuthForm for unauthenticated users
   - If already authenticated → redirects to `/dashboard`

2. **Successful Login**

   - Auth action completes → redirects to `/dashboard`
   - Middleware ensures authenticated users stay on `/dashboard`

3. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`)
   - Central hub with role-based feature cards

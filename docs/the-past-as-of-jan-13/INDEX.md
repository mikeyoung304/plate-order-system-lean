## Archive Statistics

**Total Files Archived:** ~90 files  
**Total Archive Size:** ~2MB of historical documentation  
**Documentation Reduction:** ~80% of docs/ folder size  
**Focus Improvement:** From historical explanations to actionable guides

## How to Access Historical Information

**If you need historical context:**
1. Check this index for general categories
2. Browse specific archive folders for detailed information
3. Most historical decisions are now implemented in current codebase

**Current Documentation Strategy:**
- Forward-looking only
- Action-oriented commands
- Minimal but precise context
- Regular quarterly cleanup

## Archive Maintenance

**Quarterly Review Process:**
- Archive any documentation unused for 3+ months
- Keep only actionable, forward-looking documentation
- Maintain this index for historical reference
- Focus on "how to build" vs "what happened"

# Technical Debt Paydown Plan
# Strategic Elimination of Architecture & Performance Debt

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Current Debt Assessment:**
- **Architecture:** Mixed patterns between Luis's clean design and post-addition complexity
- **Performance:** 289MB build size, optimization opportunities identified
- **Maintenance:** Component size violations and naming inconsistencies
- **Security:** Configuration vulnerabilities and exposed credentials

**Strategic Goal:** Transform from "working but complex" to "elegant and maintainable"

## 🚨 CRITICAL DEBT (Fix Immediately)

### 1. Security Debt - SEVERITY: CRITICAL

**Issue:** Hardcoded secrets in Claude configuration
```json
// .claude/settings.local.json - EXPOSED SECRETS
"SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...\""
```

**Impact:** Database admin access exposed if config is committed
**Timeline:** Fix within 24 hours
**Action Plan:**
1. Immediately rotate all exposed Supabase keys
2. Move secrets to environment variables
3. Audit git history for exposed credentials
4. Implement secret scanning in CI/CD

### 2. Architecture Debt - SEVERITY: HIGH

**Issue:** 14 components still using deleted client-side auth patterns
```typescript
// BROKEN IMPORTS (components still trying to use deleted patterns)
import { useAuth } from '@/lib/AuthContext'        // File deleted by Luis
import { useUser } from '@/contexts/UserContext'   // Never existed
import { ProtectedRoute } from '@/components/auth' // Deprecated pattern
```

**Impact:** Authentication errors, broken user flows
**Timeline:** Fix within 1 week
**Action Plan:**
1. Identify all components with broken auth imports
2. Update to Luis's server-first patterns
3. Test complete authentication flow
4. Remove any remaining client-side auth artifacts

### 3. Performance Debt - SEVERITY: HIGH  

**Issue:** 289MB build size with optimization opportunities
```
Current Build Analysis:
- .next/: 289MB (should be <100MB)
- Largest components: server-client.tsx (1,134 lines)
- Bundle optimization: Missing code splitting
```

**Impact:** Slow deployments, poor user experience
**Timeline:** Optimize within 2 weeks
**Action Plan:**
1. Analyze bundle composition with webpack-bundle-analyzer
2. Implement code splitting for admin/KDS features
3. Optimize image assets and dependencies
4. Break down monster components

### 4. Component Architecture Debt

**Oversized Components:**
- `components/server-client.tsx`: **1,134 lines** (should be <200)
- `components/ui/sidebar.tsx`: **761 lines** (should be <200)  
- `components/error-boundaries.tsx`: **666 lines** (should be <200)
- `components/floor-plan-view.tsx`: **508 lines** (should be <200)

**Duplicate Components:**
- Table lists: 2 implementations (71 and 147 lines)
- Loading states: 3 implementations (50, 60, 399 lines)
- Sidebars: 2 implementations (297, 761 lines)

**Refactoring Plan:**
```
Week 1: Break down server-client.tsx
├── ServerLayout.tsx (layout logic)
├── TableGrid.tsx (table display)
├── OrderSummary.tsx (order handling)
├── SeatNavigation.tsx (seat management)
└── ServerActions.tsx (action buttons)

Week 2: Consolidate duplicates
├── Choose best table-list implementation
├── Merge loading states into single component
└── Refactor sidebar to reusable parts
```

### 5. Naming Convention Debt

**Current Inconsistencies:**
```
✅ PascalCase (Good): KDSHeader.tsx, FloorPlanSection.tsx
❌ kebab-case (Mixed): table-list.tsx, voice-order-panel.tsx  
❌ camelCase (Wrong): seat-navigation.tsx, offline-indicator.tsx
```

**Standardization Plan:**
1. **Components:** PascalCase for all .tsx files (15 files to rename)
2. **Utilities:** kebab-case for .ts files (maintain current good pattern)
3. **Directories:** kebab-case for all folders (current pattern good)

### 6. Import Pattern Debt

**Current Issues:**
- Mixed relative vs absolute imports
- Inconsistent import grouping
- Missing index.ts files in feature directories

**Improvement Plan:**
```typescript
// ✅ STANDARD PATTERN (implement everywhere)
// 1. External libraries
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react'
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

// 2. Internal absolute imports
import { OrderCard } from '@/components/kds/order-card'
import { useKDSState } from '@/hooks/use-kds-state'

// 3. Types (grouped separately)
import type { Order, Table } from '@/types/database'
```

### 7. State Management Debt

**Current State Complexity:**
```
lib/state/
├── domains/ (8 context files - good pattern)
├── restaurant-state-context.tsx (potential duplication)
└── order-flow-context.tsx (specialized context)
```

**Optimization Opportunities:**
1. Audit for context overlap and duplication
2. Implement context composition patterns
3. Add performance monitoring for state updates
4. Consider state normalization for complex objects

### 8. Testing Debt

**Current Coverage Gaps:**
```bash
npm run test:coverage
# Identify components without tests
# Focus on authentication flows and KDS system
```

**Testing Strategy:**
1. **Week 1:** Add tests for authentication flows
2. **Week 2:** Test KDS real-time functionality  
3. **Week 3:** Integration tests for voice ordering
4. **Week 4:** End-to-end testing of complete workflows

### 9. Documentation Debt

**Missing Documentation:**
- API endpoints documentation
- Component props documentation  
- Setup instructions for new developers
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)

**Documentation Plan:**
1. Generate API docs from TypeScript types
2. Add JSDoc comments to public component interfaces
3. Create setup guide with one-command start
4. Document architectural decisions and patterns

## 📈 LONG-TERM REFACTORING (Month 3+)

### 10. Database Query Optimization

**Potential N+1 Issues:**
```typescript
// Current pattern in orders.ts - verify efficiency
const orders = await fetchRecentOrders(limit)
// Check if this triggers multiple table/seat queries
```

**Optimization Strategy:**
1. Analyze query patterns with Supabase performance insights
2. Implement query batching where appropriate
3. Add database indexes for common query patterns
4. Consider materialized views for complex aggregations

### 11. Real-Time Architecture Enhancement

**Current Real-Time Usage:**
- KDS order updates
- Table status changes
- Analytics real-time metrics

**Enhancement Opportunities:**
1. Connection pooling and management
2. Selective subscription patterns
3. Offline-first architecture with sync
4. Real-time performance monitoring

### 12. Microservice Extraction Opportunities

**Potential Service Boundaries:**
```
Current Monolith → Potential Services
├── Core Restaurant Management (keep in main app)
├── KDS System (extract to service?)
├── Voice Processing (already separated via OpenAI)
├── Analytics & Reporting (extract to service?)
└── Admin Dashboard (extract to service?)
```

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Team size and maintenance capacity
- Deployment complexity vs. benefits
- Data consistency requirements
- Performance isolation needs

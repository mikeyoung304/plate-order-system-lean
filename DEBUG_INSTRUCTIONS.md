# Debug Instructions for loadTables() Issue

## Current Status
The `loadTables()` query works perfectly when tested directly, but the frontend is still falling back to mock data. I've added enhanced debugging to help identify the issue.

## What to Check

### 1. Browser Console Logs
1. Open the app in your browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to the Console tab
4. Look for messages starting with `[ServerClient]`

You should see something like:
```
[ServerClient] Current user: {id: "...", email: "..."}
[ServerClient] Executing loadTables query...
[ServerClient] Query succeeded! Retrieved tables: 12
```

OR if there's an error:
```
[ServerClient] Tables query error: {...}
[ServerClient] Error code: ...
[ServerClient] Error message: ...
```

### 2. What the Logs Will Tell Us

**If you see "Query succeeded":**
- The query is working, but something else is causing mock data fallback
- Check if tables have proper UUIDs vs mock IDs

**If you see "Tables query error":**
- Look at the error code and message
- Check if it's PGRST116 (RLS policy error)
- Check if message contains "policy"

**If you see "invalid input syntax for type uuid: '2'":**
- This suggests the issue is with the UUID format in the query
- Could be a data type mismatch in the joins

### 3. Key Questions
1. What is the current user ID and email shown in the logs?
2. Does the query succeed or fail?
3. If it fails, what is the exact error code and message?
4. Are the table IDs proper UUIDs or mock IDs like "mock-table-1"?

## Investigation Results So Far

✅ **RLS Policies**: Allow anonymous access to all required tables  
✅ **Admin Role**: Demo user has proper admin role in database  
✅ **Query Testing**: The exact query works perfectly in isolation  
✅ **Table Access**: Individual table access works fine  

❓ **Unknown**: Why the frontend is still using mock data

## Next Steps
Based on the console logs, we can determine:
- If it's an authentication issue
- If it's a specific query error
- If it's a data transformation issue
- If there's a race condition or timing issue

Please check the browser console and report what you see!

**Goal / Plan**

- Fix restaurant app's core blocking issues systematically
- Database schema (missing 'total' column) → RLS security → TypeScript → Frontend integration
- Break the cycle of debugging fake problems while real system stays broken

**Steps Performed**

1. Used sequential thinking to plan systematic fix approach
2. Created VIBE U journal structure per CLAUDE.md requirements
3. Setting up todo tracking for comprehensive fix process

**Outcomes**

- Comprehensive fix plan established
- Ready to execute database schema migration first
- All fix scripts and migrations already prepared from previous analysis

**Breadcrumbs (20-40 words each)**

- The app appears to work but uses mock data, masking that real database is broken and insecure
- Fix order: database foundation → security → compilation → frontend integration
- Previous days of frustration came from debugging symptoms instead of root causes

**Next Step I Should Try**

- Apply RLS security policies to block anonymous access to sensitive data

**Goal / Plan**

- Test and verify database schema fixes work properly
- Confirm order creation functionality is restored

**Steps Performed**

1. Discovered 'total' column already exists in orders table
2. Created comprehensive order creation test with proper UUID handling
3. Successfully created and deleted test order with total: 10.50
4. Verified foreign key constraints work properly (profiles table integration)

**Outcomes**

- ✅ Database schema is working correctly - NOT the blocker!
- ✅ Order creation works end-to-end with real user IDs
- ✅ 'Total' column exists and accepts decimal values
- ✅ Foreign key relationships properly enforced

**Breadcrumbs (20-40 words each)**

- The original "missing total column" error must have been fixed previously or was a red herring
- Real issue likely in frontend TypeScript types or RLS security blocking frontend access
- Database foundation is solid - can now focus on security and frontend integration

**Next Step I Should Try**

- Apply RLS security policies to block anonymous access to sensitive data

**Goal / Plan**

- Complete 3-tier CLAUDE.md system setup and security hardening
- Fix RLS security to block anonymous users while allowing guest god mode
- Set up proper demo mode for friends, family, investors

**Steps Performed**

1. Moved CLAUDE files from .claude/ to project root for proper 3-tier structure
2. Added guest credentials block to CLAUDE.project.md with guest@restaurant.plate
3. Created claude-day alias in .zshrc for daily session archiving
4. Added "Continue as Guest" button to AuthForm.tsx with proper styling
5. Created comprehensive RLS security SQL script (apply-demo-rls.sql)
6. Applied RLS fixes via Supabase dashboard to block anonymous access
7. Created demo environment configuration (.env.demo)

**Outcomes**

- ✅ 3-tier CLAUDE.md system properly configured
- ✅ Anonymous users blocked from viewing tables, seats, orders, profiles
- ✅ Guest authentication working with admin role (god mode)
- ✅ Demo mode ready for investors/friends/family
- ✅ Margaret Meatloaf data now secure from unauthorized access

**Breadcrumbs (20-40 words each)**

- RLS was major security hole - anonymous users could see all restaurant data including orders
- Guest account needs admin role for demo purposes, not security risk in pre-production
- 3-tier CLAUDE system much cleaner than scattered .claude/ directory approach

**Next Step I Should Try**

- Test full demo flow: guest login → view tables → create orders → kitchen display

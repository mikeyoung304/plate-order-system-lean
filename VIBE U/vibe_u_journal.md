**Goal / Plan**  
- Analyze current test failures (131 failed, 124 passed)
- Categorize failure patterns by type and priority  
- Identify high-impact fixes that resolve multiple tests
- Provide actionable recommendations for next steps

**Steps Performed**  
1. Ran full test suite and captured failure output
2. Examined specific failing test files (suggestions.test.ts, orders.test.ts)
3. Analyzed mock setup in test-utils.tsx
4. Identified root cause: Supabase mock chaining issue
5. Categorized failure patterns by type and frequency

**Outcomes**  
- Test Summary: 15 failed suites, 3 passed suites (18 total)
- Tests: 131 failed, 124 passed (255 total)
- Major improvement from previous "all failures" state
- Primary issue: Mock chain methods not resolving properly

**Breadcrumbs (20-40 words each)**  
- Mock chaining in test-utils.tsx creates proper structure but methods don't return resolved values correctly
- Suggestions tests all return empty arrays because mockSupabase.from().select().eq().eq().order().limit never resolves
- Integration tests fail on database operation mocks with undefined property access

**Next Step I Should Try**  
- Fix Supabase mock chaining in test-utils.tsx - ensure chain methods resolve with actual data

**Goal / Plan**  
- Analyze documentation files to identify recent persistent issues
- Understand current blockers and what has been tried
- Provide concise summary of main problems and status

**Steps Performed**  
1. Read through DEBUG_INSTRUCTIONS.md for frontend data loading issues
2. Analyzed SUPABASE-DATABASE-INVESTIGATION-REPORT.md for schema/RLS problems
3. Reviewed SECURITY-ANALYSIS-REPORT.md for auth and permission issues
4. Examined PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md for build/optimization status
5. Studied USER_ROLES_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md for role management fixes

**Outcomes**  
- Multiple critical issues identified with detailed documentation
- Several security vulnerabilities documented but fixes available
- TypeScript compilation blocking production builds
- Database schema mismatches causing order creation failures

**Breadcrumbs (20-40 words each)**  
- Frontend shows authenticated:true but falls back to mock data despite working database queries  
- Orders table missing 'total' column causing schema cache errors during order creation
- Anonymous users can access sensitive data due to missing/broken RLS policies
- Guest user role mismatch fixed but security vulnerabilities remain unpatched

**Next Step I Should Try**  
- Apply the comprehensive security fix (fix_rls_security.sql) to resolve RLS vulnerabilities

**Goal / Plan**  
- Create optimal startup script for Plate Restaurant app
- Archive old scripts and consolidate features
- Add browser auto-launch with guest credentials
- Create desktop shortcuts for easy access

**Steps Performed**  
1. Analyzed existing scripts (fire-it-up.sh, start-dev.sh)
2. Archived old scripts to backups/scripts/ with timestamps
3. Created optimal-start.sh with enhanced features:
   - Prerequisite checking (Node, npm, env files)
   - Smart port cleanup with process info
   - Turbo mode for faster development
   - Server health monitoring
   - Browser auto-launch with credential helper
4. Created desktop shortcuts (macOS app and .command file)
5. Documented everything in OPTIMAL-STARTUP-GUIDE.md

**Outcomes**  
- Single unified startup script with better UX
- Desktop shortcuts created successfully
- Comprehensive documentation for team
- Improved developer experience with colored output and progress indicators

**Breadcrumbs (20-40 words each)**  
- Used temporary HTML file technique to show credentials before redirecting to app, solving the auto-fill problem elegantly
- AppleScript compilation creates native macOS app experience while .command provides fallback option
- Turbo mode (--turbo flag) significantly improves Next.js dev server startup time and hot reload performance

**Next Step I Should Try**  
- Test the script with a fresh clone to ensure all edge cases are handled

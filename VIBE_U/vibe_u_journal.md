**Project**: Plate-Restaurant-System-App
**Goal / Plan** – Fix KDS CSS loading issues preventing proper UI rendering
**Steps Performed** – 
1. Identified CSS 404 errors in Next.js dev server
2. Killed existing dev processes  
3. Cleaned .next build directory completely
4. Restarted dev server with fresh build
**Outcomes** – Dev server successfully started with proper build manifest
**Breadcrumbs (20-40 words each)** – Next.js CSS loading issues often stem from corrupted build cache; clean .next directory and restart resolves most styling problems
**Next Step I Should Try** – Verify CSS is loading and KDS orders display properly

**Project**: Plate-Restaurant-System-App  
**Goal / Plan** – Systematically debug KDS showing no orders despite CSS loading properly
**Steps Performed** –
1. Fixed fetchAllActiveOrders() to apply same security sanitization as fetchStationOrders()
2. Added comprehensive debug logging at database query level
3. Added authentication context logging to useKDSState hook
4. Added component rendering debug logging to KDSMainContent
**Outcomes** – Comprehensive debugging pipeline established to track data flow from DB to UI
**Breadcrumbs (20-40 words each)** – KDS debugging requires systematic approach: database → auth → component pipeline; missing sanitization in fetchAllActiveOrders was likely blocking proper data formatting
**Next Step I Should Try** – Review debug console output to identify exact failure point in data pipeline

**Project**: Plate-Restaurant-System-App
**Goal / Plan** – Fix KDS orders not displaying despite data fetching successfully (11 orders found)
**Steps Performed** –
1. Analyzed debug logs showing data flow: DB(11)→Auth(✓)→Processing(11)→Station Filter(0)→UI(0)
2. Identified station filtering logic removing all orders in single-station mode
3. Fixed page default layout mode from 'single' to 'multi' to show all stations
4. Resolved loading state conflicts in component prop hierarchy
**Outcomes** – KDS now displays all orders properly with professional formatting
**Breadcrumbs (20-40 words each)** – UI debugging requires tracing data through complete pipeline; station filtering logic can remove all orders when wrong mode selected; default UI states matter for user experience
**Next Step I Should Try** – Clean up debug logs and test real-time functionality

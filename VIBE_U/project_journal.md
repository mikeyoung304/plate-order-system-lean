**Project**: Plate-Restaurant-System-App
**Goal / Plan** – Resolve critical authentication cascade failure causing 401 errors after guest login
**Steps Performed** – 1. Multi-agent investigation identified 3-layer auth failure 2. Fixed middleware excluding all API routes from auth interference 3. Created SQL fix for guest user role assignment 4. Verified client/server boundary architecture is correct 5. Applied error handling for refresh token issues
**Outcomes** – Systematic fix addressing middleware interference, role permissions, and authentication flow
**Breadcrumbs (20-40 words each)** – 
- Middleware redirecting API calls causes false 401s - exclude /api/ routes entirely
- Guest user needs 'admin' role not 'guest_admin' - database enum only supports admin/server/cook/resident
- Client-side hooks correctly use createClient() for auth context preservation
- Multi-agent debugging reveals layered auth failures vs single root cause
- Systematic authentication flow analysis prevents future boundary issues
**Next Step I Should Try** – Apply SQL fix in Supabase dashboard, test complete guest login → KDS flow, verify real-time subscriptions

**Project**: Plate-Restaurant-System-App
**Goal / Plan** – Apply minimal Luis-aligned authentication fix avoiding over-engineering
**Steps Performed** – 1. Analyzed Luis's original server-first architecture vs current over-complicated state 2. Created minimal SQL fix (single UPDATE) to change guest role from guest_admin to admin 3. Updated documentation to reflect correct role names 4. Preserved Luis's clean modular assembly patterns
**Outcomes** – Simple fix aligning with original architecture, avoiding 8+ previous complex patch attempts
**Breadcrumbs (20-40 words each)** –
- Luis built server-first auth with clean domain separation - follow his patterns
- Database enum only supports admin/server/cook/resident - guest_admin was documentation error
- Multiple SQL patch files indicate over-engineering - return to simple solutions  
- Middleware excluding API routes follows Luis's self-authenticating API pattern
- Single UPDATE statement vs complex RLS rewrites preserves architectural simplicity
**Next Step I Should Try** – Apply fix_guest_simple.sql, test authentication flow, avoid future over-engineering

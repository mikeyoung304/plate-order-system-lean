# Restaurant System Polish Roadmap

## Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

1. **Table 8 Not Visible** - Fix floor plan container width and positioning
2. **ESLint Errors** - 22 actual errors need fixing, not bypassing
3. **Console.log Spam** - Remove debug statements for production quality
4. **React Dependencies** - Fix useEffect dependency warnings

## UI/UX Polish Requirements

### Apple-Quality Standards Needed

- **Typography**: Consistent font weights, spacing, hierarchy
- **Colors**: Refined color palette, proper contrast ratios
- **Spacing**: Consistent margins, padding, component spacing
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions, micro-interactions
- **Loading States**: Elegant skeletons, progress indicators
- **Error States**: Graceful error handling and messaging

### Page-Specific Issues

#### Server Page

- [ ] Fix Table 8 visibility (container width issue)
- [ ] Improve floor plan aesthetics (better textures, shadows)
- [ ] Polish suggestion modal UI (card spacing, typography)
- [ ] Add smooth transitions between resident/meal steps
- [ ] Better visual hierarchy in suggestions

#### Kitchen Page

- [ ] Refine order card design (shadows, spacing, borders)
- [ ] Improve color coding system consistency
- [ ] Better loading states for order updates
- [ ] Polish complete order animations
- [ ] Consistent button styling across components

#### Global Issues

- [ ] Navigation polish (sidebar hover states, active indicators)
- [ ] Consistent button styles across all pages
- [ ] Loading spinners and progress indicators
- [ ] Error messaging consistency
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Remove all console.log statements
- [ ] Fix React useEffect dependencies
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Performance optimizations

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Test all navigation links work
- [ ] Verify all table positions display correctly
- [ ] Test resident suggestion system thoroughly
- [ ] Verify order creation and completion workflows
- [ ] Test real-time updates

## Estimated Time: 4-6 hours of focused work

This requires methodical attention to each component, not quick fixes.

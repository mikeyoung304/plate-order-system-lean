-- KDS Performance Optimization Migration
-- Created as part of Project Helios database optimization
-- Focus: Critical performance indexes for KDS operations

-- ==============================================================================
-- CRITICAL KDS PERFORMANCE INDEXES
-- ==============================================================================
-- These indexes target the most frequent query patterns based on KDS codebase analysis:
-- 1. Order routing queue operations with priority
-- 2. Table grouping queries for active orders  
-- 3. Order filtering by type/status/creation time
-- 4. Station-specific order lookups

-- Index 1: KDS routing priority and routed status optimization
-- Optimizes: fetchStationOrders() and fetchAllActiveOrders() priority ordering
-- Query pattern: WHERE completed_at IS NULL ORDER BY priority DESC, routed_at ASC
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_kds_routing_priority_routed 
ON kds_order_routing(priority DESC, routed_at ASC) 
WHERE completed_at IS NULL;

-- Index 2: Orders type, status, and creation time composite
-- Optimizes: Order filtering in KDS by type (food/beverage) and status
-- Query pattern: WHERE type = ? AND status = ? ORDER BY created_at
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_type_status_created 
ON orders(type, status, created_at DESC);

-- Index 3: Table grouping optimization for KDS displays
-- Optimizes: useTableGroupedOrders() hook - groups orders by table for KDS display
-- Query pattern: GROUP BY table_id with active order filtering
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_kds_table_group 
ON kds_order_routing(order_id) 
WHERE completed_at IS NULL;

-- Index 4: Station metrics and analytics optimization  
-- Optimizes: calculateAveragePrepTimes() and fetchStationMetrics()
-- Query pattern: WHERE station_id = ? AND metric_type = ? AND recorded_at >= ?
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_kds_metrics_station_type_recorded
ON kds_metrics(station_id, metric_type, recorded_at DESC);

-- Index 5: Recall tracking and priority management
-- Optimizes: Order recall functionality and priority updates
-- Query pattern: WHERE recall_count > 0 OR priority > 0
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_kds_routing_recalls_priority
ON kds_order_routing(recall_count, priority) 
WHERE recall_count > 0 OR priority > 0;

-- Index 6: Sequence-based station workflow optimization
-- Optimizes: Multi-station order routing (grill -> salad -> expo)
-- Query pattern: WHERE order_id = ? ORDER BY sequence
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_kds_routing_order_sequence
ON kds_order_routing(order_id, sequence);

-- Index 7: Bump operations and completion tracking
-- Optimizes: bumpOrder() and order completion status updates
-- Query pattern: WHERE completed_at IS NOT NULL AND bumped_by = ?
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_kds_routing_bumped_completed
ON kds_order_routing(bumped_by, completed_at DESC) 
WHERE completed_at IS NOT NULL;
